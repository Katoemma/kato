          About Me
        </h2>

        <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          I'm a full-stack software engineer with deep experience in
          GIS systems, Laravel, Vue, Flutter, and spatial data pipelines.
          I focus on building products that are reliable, scalable,
          and easy for real teams to use.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
          I've worked on land restoration platforms, HR systems,
          mapping tools, and offline-first applications across web,
          mobile, and desktop.
